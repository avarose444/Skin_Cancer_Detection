# Skin_Cancer_Detection
This repository contains code, data, and final figures for a skin cancer classification project using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and dermatoscopic image analysis.

**Developers:** Lily Ellis, Ava Ferrentino, Lily Saada, and Olivia Matlaga

Inspired by research and applications of deep learning in medical imaging, this project explores automated skin cancer detection using TensorFlow/Keras.
